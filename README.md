# 17 - Canvas Animation

###### ICS4U - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è

In this lesson (which is 100% in-class demonstration), we will:  
- Learn how to debug "modules" in the browser dev tools
- Learn how to refresh the canvas very quickly with [`requestAnimationFrame()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_requestanimationframe.asp)
  - It's worth noting that `requestAnimationFrame()` is **_not_** just for the `<canvas>` element.

#### Notes:

- The sprite sheets inside the images folder are from [the Chrome dino game](chrome://dino/)
